								Tong Nhat Quan: Web Developer<br>
								Dang Anh Huy: Informaiton Security<br>
								Cao Thien Bao: Program Developer<p>
								<p>Most of our ideal jobs are related to developing. Therefore, we must all have enough knowledge and skills to code. But the content of which inside the codes of each person will be different. For example, "Game Developer" requires you to understand the concept of physics within the computer language to transfer information from the real-life world to computer language and create a digital world. For a "Web Developer", this job will require us to have a deep understanding of the "Internet" and networking so that the website will operate easily and can not be hacked. On the other hand, "Program Developer" must have a full understanding of the computer language to create, debug, or even manipulate a program to work as the person desires. For "Information Security", this job will require us to always look for a loop-hole that can be exploited within the system so that we can improve and protect the information whether it's in hardware or software or even the Internet.
								Our career plans will not very much be different because our jobs are are all related to programing and developing. We can all work freelance or 
								work for a company, except for information where you must have contacts in order to get hired. <p>
