								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<p>I am a game addict, i could play my favorite games for up to 10 hours without rest. 3 words to describe me are: Optimistic, Introverted and Quiet. 
								In IT, I like to see people do their programming and especially in web development. My interest about IT started just last year, when I was in grade 12 and I have no idea about what I am going to learn and to be in the future then one night when I was watching Youtube, i saw a Youtube video with the title ”Cool text animation using HTML” I clicked on that and saw a person typing some kind code line and then the person run the code a website pop up with a lot of cool effect and at the time I think that i’m going to study IT.<p>
