								<h2>Comparison</h2>
								<p>Phan Phuc An: Game Developer<br>
								Tong Nhat Quan: Web Developer<br>
								Dang Anh Huy: Informaiton Security<br>
								Cao Thien Bao: Program Developer<p>
								<h2>Similar</h2>
								<p>The similarities between out career plans are:<br>
								1: Involving in computer languages and coding<br>
								2: Requires simple devices such as computers, laptops, cpu and all the compnets that needs to run a decent machine that understands coding<br>
								3: Requires less physical movements able to withstands long periods of sitting in one place<br>
								<h2>Difference</h2>
								<p>The differences between our career plans are:<br>
								1: Different types of languages: It is not compulsory for Game Developer to understand network language or even the internet whereas Web Developer, Information Security requires a vast knowledge in the world of networking and Program Developer is general in every way, offline or online or even any types of languages that fit the Program Developer.<br>
                                2: Different kinds of coding: Game developer and Program Developer can create, make, and freely adjust the code however they see fit. But Web Developer and Information Security need to follow instructions on how other people want their website is displayed or the way of how we should keep the file secured.<br>
								3: Different positions: Game and Program Developer can choose to be independent. Therefore, if anything happens, no one else should have any effect other than the developer themselves. But Web Developers and Information Security require clients, people that ask for your skills and work together. Leading to if one party went wrong, then the other has to also face the consequence and take responsibility.<p>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<P>All of our career plans will not require any strong physical demands and all need to have basic knowledge of computing. However, Program and Game Developer have more flexible and general choices when it comes to career, we can choose to work for other people or be our own boss. This could be an advantage and also disadvantage due to having many option and choices that you'll have to make along the way. On the other hand, Web Developer and Information Security require strong and positive attitude because other people and company will rely on you to make their data and information safe as well as present their name as a trustworthy place when everyone logs in to the website you have created for them. You don't have to worry about employment because there will always people that need a website or their data protected.<p>
