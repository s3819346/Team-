								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<p>My hobbies are listening to music, reading news, cooking and my favorite sport is basketball. My interest in IT is coding and solving computer issues. Because I was impressed by the logical and accurate of a code which is needed to make a software, or a program runs correctly and effectively without having mistaken. Besides, I usually deal with the computer issues, each time solving I was interested by how the problem occur and how to fix it effectively.
								when I was in high school, on that time I get to know how to make a code and how to fix computer issues. Then start practicing with some simple math calculations and practice fixing problems from the simple one to the complicated one. Yes, a particular event as well as a person both sparked my interest. About an event, when I was in grade 12, in an informatics lesson the teacher taught about coding and how to make a code that do a math calculation then gave me and my class an amount of time to practice the activities by ourselves. After that practicing time, I started to find interest in IT when I success in making a logical code and make the program calculated correctly. Otherwise, I usually watch and learn from a technical supporter who is my momâ€™s friend each time he fixes my computer problems and he explain specifically about the problem occurred and how he is going to fix it.<p>
