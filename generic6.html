								<p>We work together quite well in Assignment 2, everyone is active when times come work to on the part that has been given and agreed by the group. The result that has for assignment 2 is quite alright, but we know we could do better and make the project cleaner and easy to understand. We communicate using social media such as Facebook through text and voice chat, but we still can't find the time to meet in person because some of our team members have a busy schedule. But in Assignment 3, we found the time to get together as a group to discuss our project in person and the result is much better than we all expected. We are now more confident in our project for Assignment 3 more than Assignment 2. Overall, we've made some process through our journey and we hope to grow in the future to make our projects brings even better results. If there are any changes that we need to make, is that our team member must find the time to discuss our project not just in social media, but face-to-face, and we are currently doing that as well. Clear our schedule, meet up, discuss, and bring better results than ever before.<p>
