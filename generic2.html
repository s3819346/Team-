								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<p>I love playing video games, especially a fast pace shooter game such as CS:GO or Call of Duty, I am also addicted to listening to music and watching movies mainly fantasy or action type of genres. When I am free, I usually take a language course, during this summer I have learn some French because I heard that it would be great if I could incorporate French into learning IT and for the reason that I also enjoy acquiring another language.
								I have always been a tech addict since I was a child, my dad who is an enthusiast teach me a lot about technology and how it could have a great impact in the future and that gives me a tremendous passion to pursue this major.
								At a young age, I found the technology and their advancement very enjoyable because they help to make our lives better with each development. Then this excitement started to grow on me and soon I found myself inseparable with technology, I regularly rely on technology that helps us to do our task easier and things that remind me whenever I need.<p>
